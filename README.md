# NetworkDesignForSchool
Using Cisco Packet Tracer I have built a complex Network design for school.

# INTRODUCTION

The scope of this proposal is to create a better network School Area that will allow them flexibility in the following categories:

     1. Security
     2. Network Scalability
     3. Emailing and FTP using
     4. Own Server
     5. Data backup

There is no VPN for the school to provide separation from the public network.
